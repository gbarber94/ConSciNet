## Summary

Given an unknown dynamical system, we are often interested in gaining insights into its physical
parameters. For instance, given an observation of the motion of a harmonic oscillator in the form of
video frames or time-series data, we wish to know the stiffness and mass. How
do we do this from observation and without the knowledge of the dynamics model? In this paper,
we present a neural framework for estimating physical parameters in a manner consistent with the
underlying physics. The neural framework uses a deep latent variable model that disentangles the
systemâ€™s physical parameters from canonical coordinate observations. The network then returns a
Hamiltonian parameterization that generalizes well with respect to the discovered physical parameters.
We apply our framework to simple dynamical problems and show that it discovers physically
meaningful parameters while respecting the governing physics.

## Getting started
- We provide two Colab notebooks for reproducing the results.
- Data: the simulated coordinate data used in training is provided in the `data` directory as a set of pickle files. This data can be load using `utlis/data_loader.py`. The  data generation functions for each system can be found in their respective files: `utils/pendulum_system.py` and `utils/spring_system.py`. 
- Model: the ConSciNet implementation can be found in the model directory `model/conscinet.py`. The trained model weights used in the results are available in `model/weights`.
